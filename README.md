# Software Engineering Project : Software Requirements Specification(SRS) document for Face Identification System

Professor : Ms. Bela Shah and Ms. Bhumi

## Aim & Objective : 
This project is intended to identify a person using the images previously taken. The identifications can be done on the basis of images stored in the form of slices of head, eyes, lips, DNA, nose etc.

## Problem Statement: 
The development of a reliable program to perform Face Identification of Criminal is still a challenge today. Many had underestimated the complexity of this problem as identification of face is a process that can be easily done by Human eyes. However, for a computer system to model and imitate the face of criminal, there are many challenges involved. One of the challenges faced in Face Identification is poor resolution of the images of the criminals and are hard to identify. Another thing which can hamper the identification of criminal is poor knowledge of eyewitness and the ability of operator to imitate the face 
of criminal.

Criminal record generally contains personal information about particular person along with photograph. To identify any Criminal we need some identification regarding 
person, which are given by eyewitness. Identification can be done in many ways like finger print, eyes, DNA etc. One of the applications is face identification. The face is our primary focus of attention in social inter course playing a major role in conveying identifications and emotion. Although the ability to infer intelligence or character from facial appearance is suspect, the human ability to recognize face is remarkable.

## Overview of the Project:
This project is aimed to identify the criminals in any investigation department. Here the technique is we already store some images of the criminals in our database along with his details and those images are segmented into many slices say eyes, hairs, lips, nose, etc. These images are again stored in another database record so to identify any criminals; eyewitnesses will see the images or slices that appear on the screen by using it we develop the face, which may or may not be matched with our images. If any image is matched up to 99% then we predict that he is only the criminal. Thus using this project it provides a very friendly environment for both operator and eyewitness to easily design any face can identify criminals very easy.
